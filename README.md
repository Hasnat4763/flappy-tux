# Flappy Tux


We all love that cute penguin from the linux OS don't we?

I made a flappy bird clone but instead of the birb its our TUX!?!??!?!

Play it today in https://hasnat4763.itch.io/flappy-tux

It is my 1st time making a game and using Godot so there is some problems but I tried my best

# Stuff used

Godot to develop the game
Blockbench to Make Textures

I also used a bit of AI but it is not that much

Submitting it to Hack Club Siege
